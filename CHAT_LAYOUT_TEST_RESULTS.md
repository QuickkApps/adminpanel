# Chat Layout Modification Test Results

## 🎯 Objective
Move the statistics section to the left sidebar above "Support Conversations" text and remove unwanted conversation items (XT30560, sda).

## ✅ Changes Made

        <span class="stat-label">TOTAL CONVERSATIONS</span>
    </div>
    <!-- ... more stats ... -->
</div>
```

```javascript
// Conversation filtering
